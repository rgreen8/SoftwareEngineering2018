Overall I am a fan of the observer design pattern. I think it had the ablity of taking what seems like a complex issue - location tracking and chasing - and make it much more approachable. I though the update functionality was very powerful and intuative. When implementing, I orignally hardcoded much of my work and had to go back and work on scalablitity and readability once core functionality was established. A regret of my design, due to time constraints, was not being able to put as much abstraction over the JavaFX functions. Though they are very powerful, using so many left the code less readable to someone who knows little about Java. 
The core part of my project, and a key design decision was using the oceanMap as the main trace of islands and borders and was passed into all classes as a way to make sure no ships went on land, and that all objects were on the same page. 
In order to complete the stretch functionality, I would like to increase the functionality of the the oceanMap class. I think the button would be fairly straight forward, as I could alway quick the window and re-seed the random number in isIsland. Also, functionality could be added to allow for that class to read in a number of islands to create. In order to add more images, much like what was done with the pirates, a list would need to be made of all the children to be added to the scene. This would then need to be subsitured out. I also think it could help to make an island and water class in order to hold image information and file pull, and then in OceanMap just assign a class to each coordinate.
