Homework 5 Reflection

1) Design Changes I Made
- To the overall look of the map, I added a second railroad track, and had a reversed train go across it. As well added a second road which was used at random times for a car to switch lanes. 
- To add the functinoality of the 2nd Train I added new methods to the train class allowing it to run and start in the reverse position. As well as added a passed in variable allowing the train direction to be specified at time of creation. 
- The addition of the second train required me to make the gates observers of both trains, and some of thier update logic had to be re-worked. In the system now, clossing the gate as a train approaches only requires one train's command, however both trains have to request in order for a gate to be sent up. 
- The next changes made where in order to allow the car to go accross the lane in the middle. This proved more difficult. I started with getting cars the option to turn. This was done in adding a variable to the road creation which allowed for the car factory on that road to allow for cars to turn on not to turn. All cars on the right now had a 1 in 4 chance that they would turn onto the cross road. Next, I worked on having the car move over to the left until it is in the next lane. At this time, the car following the turning car would ussually stop so within the turn function, its position is set to -1, which prevents the following car from thinking it is too close. 
- The final change, which I was not succesfully able to implement was to have the cars in the left lane stop if a car from the cross road was trying to merge. I ran out of time, however I was working on implmenting a static variable that would alert all cars if a merging car was coming close, they would check thier position, and stop if close to the intersection. I was experiencing bugs when two cars 

2) Ability to Scale
- The gate and and train achietecture could be scaled, as in order to adjust the gates, you could add to the aggrement counter and instead of having a trainrev variable, that could be a bitmap which allows for any direction to be established. I think my process on turning and switching lanes would be tough to expand as the system right now is based off of pixels and not based of the road locations on the map. Also, using global variables to determine the state of the intersection would get very confusing if more than one interface was included. I think to do it proporly it would be required to have a gate class and a intersection class.
